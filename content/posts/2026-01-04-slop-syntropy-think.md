- slop: named Merriam-Webster’s word of the year for 2025. It defines: digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of AI.

- syntropy: is the act of creating clarity, coherence, and usable signal out of chaos. It's the opposite of entropy --the natural slide toward disorder where information gets noisy, dashboards bloat, and decisions degrade.

- think: “Think” that single word was used by Watson as a guiding principle at IBM beginning in the 1910s–1920s. It appeared on signs, employee materials, and especially on the “THINK” notebooks given to IBM staff.

> Thinking is the hardest work there is, which is probably the reason why so few engage in it. - Thomas J. Watson
