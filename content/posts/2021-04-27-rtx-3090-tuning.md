- RTX 3090 has a terrible VRAM temperature (104C) while mining ~100mh/s. Need to replace the heatsink paste and 
thermal pad.

- The heatsink I use is Thermalright TF8 Thermal Compound Paste 13.8 W/mK, Carbon Based High Performance, Heatsink Paste at Amazon: https://amzn.to/3aJpcGp

- The thermal pad I use is Thermalright Thermal Pad 12.8 W/mK, 85x45x2mm at Amazon: https://amzn.to/3u009pX
